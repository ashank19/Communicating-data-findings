# Communicating-data-findings
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part,  Python visualization libraries are used to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part,a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that is discovered in selected dataset. The primary method of conveying findings will be through transforming exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
